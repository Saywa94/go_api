# Basic api in Go

A very basic api in golang.

Mainly for learning purposes. The code here closely follows a youtube tutorial by Net Ninja and dreamsofcode.

The api connects to a redis db. Locally, redis is running on port 6379, from a docker container.
We start one with the following command: `docker run -p 6379:6379 redis:latest`.
